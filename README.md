- 👋 Hi, I’m @rchavp
- 👀 I’m interested in programming paradigms, systems integration, machine learning and anything that feels like I'm just playing with big boy toys. Oh and also playing Quake and Doom mods.
- 🌱 I’m currently learning Reactive Programing and Machine Learning
- 💞️ I’m looking to collaborate on open source projects.
- 📫 You may reach out to me on r_chav@yahoo.com
